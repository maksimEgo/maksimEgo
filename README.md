    👋 Hi there, I'm @Maksim Egorov, a passionate learner with a keen interest in AI, Web Development, PHP, and the Symfony framework. 🐸
    👀 This repository serves as a testament to my ongoing learning journey. It is where I delve deep into the intricacies of various databases, strive to understand migrations and Doctrine, and enhance my skill set with Composer and Docker. ✔️
    🌱 As a firm believer in continuous learning, I'm also currently improving my English and diving into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in PHP, guided by Zandstra's book. Moreover, my exploration extends to the fundamental principles of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. There's just something about paper books that fuels my passion for learning!
